Back in high school, I often noticed how many students carried a quiet dislike for mathematics. It was seen as tough, boring, and far removed from anything useful in daily life. Coming back to my school years later as an invided guest speaker, I felt grateful to have the chance to challenge that perception and share a different side of the subject- its playfulness, elegance, and beauty- through a session I titled “Glimpse into the Beauty of Mathematics.”

The school principal, Mrs. Radha Venkatesh, and school math teachers were incredibly supportive in making the event possible. Walking into the same hall where I once sat as a student, this time as invided guest sharing what I had learned, was a special feeling in itself.

The session wasn’t a lecture, it was more of a conversation. We played math-inspired games, solved puzzles together, and explored how ideas from combinatorics and problem-solving actually show up in surprising ways in real life. I wanted students to see that math isn’t just about formulas on a blackboard but it’s a way of thinking, of discovering patterns, of solving problems. To keep their curiosity alive, I left them with a few puzzles and shared a handbook I had prepared with explanations and references for further exploration.

What struck me most was the curiosity that surfaced during the Q&A that followed. Students weren’t just asking about the session, they wanted to know about careers in research, about what it means to study science deeply, about the paths available through India’s national institutes, and about government programs that encourage young people to take up research. It was heartening to see their eyes light up at the thought that pure math and science research could open so many doors.

Looking back, this session wasn’t just about sharing mathematics. It was about giving back to a place that shaped me, and about sparking even a small shift in how students see a subject that is so often misunderstood.
