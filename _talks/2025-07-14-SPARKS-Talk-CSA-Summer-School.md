*This talk was part of the Indian Institute of Science, Department of Computer Science and Automation (CSA), [CSA Summer School 2025](Hypergraph Coloring and Independent Set
Problems)*

I feel fortunate to have been selected for the SPARKS (Scholars Pursuing Advanced Research in Computer Science) scholarship. As part of the CSA Summer School 2025, I had the opportunity to share and introduce my research area, supported by IISc CSA through SPARKS, with the participants.

Here are the [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14pQcU9atl9Um66IsKX3ir80AvHYEy-jD/view?usp=sharing) from my talk.
