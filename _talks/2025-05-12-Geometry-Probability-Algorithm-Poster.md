This poster was presented as a part of the [Geometry Probability and Algorithm conference at International Center for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS), Bengaluru, India](https://www.icts.res.in/discussion-meeting/gpa25).

This project (Summer Project May–August 2024) was conducted under the guidance of Dr.Rajat Mittal, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Ins􀆟tute of Technology, Kanpur,
and was funded by [SURGE IIT Kanpur](https://surge.iitk.ac.in/).

## Abstract 

In 2019, Hao Huang resolved a longstanding problem in theoretical computer science by proving that the sensitivity and degree of a Boolean function are polynomially related, thereby confirming the Sensitivity Conjecture of Nisan and Szegedy. 
Huang's result established a tght upper bound: $$bs(f) \leq s(f)^4$$. Is this power-four separaton tight? 
The largest known gap is observed in Rubinstein’s functon, where $$bs(f) = s(f)^2$$, leaving open the intriguing question: Can the bound be improved to $$bs(f) \leq s(f)^2$$?

This work investigates this question by exploring two critical complexity measures in Boolean function
analysis—sensitivity and block sensitivity—and examining the gap between them. We define a class of
functions based on the projective plane, $$f_k$$, and demonstrate that these func􀆟ons exhibit a substantial
gap between sensitivity and block sensitivity. Specifically, we show that for the projective plane function
$$f_k$$, the 0-sensitivity satisfies $$s0(f_k) = 3$$, while the 0-block sensitivity satisfies $$bs_0(f_k) \geq O(\sqrt{k})$$. By
composing this function with an OR operation, we establish a power-1.5 separa􀆟on between sensitivity and block sensitivity.

This result provides further insights into the intricate rela􀆟onship between these complexity measures and contributes to our understanding of Boolean function complexity through the lens of projective geometry.
