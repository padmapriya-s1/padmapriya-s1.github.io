## About Me

Hi! I’m Padmapriya, a master's student with a deep passion for theoretical computer science. I’m extremely grateful and fortunate to be doing my master's thesis under the joint guidance of [Dr. Pravesh Kothari](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~kothari/) (IAS, Princeton University, USA) and [Dr. Anand Louis](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~anandl/) (Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India).

My journey began as an undergraduate in physics, where an early curiosity about quantum computing sparked my interest in the elegant world of theoretical computer science. Since then, I’ve been captivated by the rich interplay between computer science, mathematics, and physics—constantly driven by a desire to explore the foundational ideas that connect them.

## Research Interests

Algorithms and Complexity theory, Beyond worst-case analysis of algorithms, Quantum Computing and Quantum Information, Boolean function complexity, Parameterized algorithms, and Machine learning.
